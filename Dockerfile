# Multi-stage build for the golden-path Python service.
#   build stage   — copies source and installs dependencies into a target dir
#   runtime stage — distroless python3 + nonroot: no shell, no package manager,
#                   runs as UID 65532, only the deps and source on disk
#
# The image is scanned by Trivy (fail on CRITICAL) and signed by cosign in the
# reusable workflow; keeping the runtime tiny keeps that surface tiny.
